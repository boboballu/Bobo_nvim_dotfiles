Jan-25-2024 :
    Karabiner :
        - Karabiner elements config added to the repo. This config excludes all the vnc tools and terminal emulators like kitty, iterm2 etc.
        - Updated the mac "finder" to use the default keymapings
        - Added commented_sections.json that holds all the don't use keymappings. This in a separate file becsuse the json config doesn't accept comments.

Feb-09-2024 :
    Clipboard management : clipboard_select.sh
        - The x11 clipboard xclip in kitty fails for unknown reason. Kitty offers clipboard in 'kitten clipboard' application and I wanted to switch the clipboard to 'kitten clipboard' if the x11 xclip fails.
        - The testing of the clipboard is buggy that if kills the x11 xclip if it already worked fine. Butchers the x11 forwarding entirely.
        - Set the default x11 server to be x11 in kitty settings
            "linux_display_server X11"
        - The code is not complete and needs some testing and corrections. The "kitten clipboard" check fails

Mar-18-2024 :
    tmux:
        - Tmux dotfiles changed to $HOME/.config dir

Future plans :
    Mar-18-2024 :
        - Make the dotfiles simple and lightweight
        - try catppuccin theme selection tool for nvim and tmux
        - remove unnecessary clutter in dotfiles
        - replace ‚ùê to the OS icon and change the tmux airline theme for OS automatically.
